INTRODUCTION.


Books on Etiquette generally confine their attention to the
usages of exclusively fashionable life, and are useful only in
forming the habits of youth, or those who, suddenly elevated
to a status higher than their natural reach, wish to adapt
themselves to a kind of society to which they are more frequently
allured by vanity than sense; for there is nothing
more really hollow than the life termed <i>par-excellence</i> <sc>FASHIONABLE</sc>.
The middle ranks of life are acknowledged to be most
tinctured with virtue, manliness, and religious feeling; for the
vanities of wealth, and the debasements of poverty, are alike
destructive of that uprightness of heart which civilization
professes to insure. Not but that there are many estimable personages
to be found in the highest walks of fashion and distinction;
and many, aye, more than would be believed, who
adorn the rugged paths of penury with the noblest examples
of gentleness of manners and moral rectitude. Still, between
these two extremes, what an enormous mass of individuals we
find, who, immured in trade, hurried along in the anxieties of
commercial life, find but few opportunities for the acquisition
of the higher kinds of knowledge, and the refining usages
which rob life of its harshness, and soften the heart in its
communion with the world. Here we find the deficiencies of
good-breeding mostly manifested; and here, too, the most
laudable desire prevails for the attainment of those polishing
touches which make us more congenial in our social intercourse,
and which, by giving our better feelings their proper
shape, by moulding our sentiments into elegance of expression,
help us to resist all temptations to petty dealing, and even to
check vice by making it unfashionable. Virtue and religion
are not only compatible with elegance of manners, but are
strengthened in their exercise by them; and every man who is
not a misanthropist, every woman who is not a nun, must feel
the necessity of attention to forms and usages, and to those
elegancies of manner which characterize good-nature and
uprightness of heart as much as they do a fashionable education.
Politeness is as essential to the man of business as to
the haunter of gaming-tables and west-end saloons; it is even
more so to remove that reproach against trading influences in
which the wealthy so often indulge. Good feeling is not
improved by roughness of manner, nor is hospitality heightened
by a negligent display. Friendship is more acceptable
when its salutations and kindly offices are well-timed; and
religion herself delights to be clothed in vestments of elegance
and purity. Every man must account it a boon to enjoy
admission to the best society, to mingle with those who, by
learning, by polite accomplishments, and by the exercise of
philanthropic and moral feelings, have lifted their lives out of
the dull round of days and hours into a region of social sunshine;
and none would willingly mar the perfection of such
circles by carrying boorish manners into their midst, or destroy
his enjoyment by the exhibition of an inaptitude to elegant
society; nay, elegance should go with us to our homes; we
should exercise politeness at the fireside to our wives, our
husbands, our children, and our kindred generally, and not
keep our good-manners exclusively as articles of exhibition to
strangers. Many heart-burnings, many foolish indulgences
in temper, many unkind words and deeds would thus be
avoided; and while elegance of manner served frequently to
check us in the pursuit of wrong, it would often prompt us to
the culture of goodness, so long as we maintained that necessary
distinction between the refinement of the heart and the
mere outside show of feigned courtesy. Such hints as are
offered here are intended to help in this direction, and are
addressed to such as have not had the advantage of polite
education and example in youth, and who may have formed
their habits under adverse circumstances, and are not too vain
of them to seek for improvement.




BLUNDERS IN BEHAVIOUR CORRECTED.


<sc>Absence of Mind.</sc>--Chesterfield, in his “Advice to his
Son,” justly characterises an absent man as unfit for business
or conversation. Absence of mind is usually affected, and
springs in most cases from a desire to be thought abstracted
in profound contemplations. The world, however, gives a
man no credit for vast ideas who exhibits absence when he
should be attentive, even to trifles. The world is right in this,
and I would implore every studious youth to forget that he is
studious when he enters company. I have seen many a man,
who would have made a bright character otherwise, affect a
foolish reserve, remove himself as far from others as possible,
and in a mixed assembly, where social prattle or sincere conversation
enlivened the hearts of the company, sit by himself
abstracted in a book. It is foolish, and, what is worse for the
absentee, it looks so. A hint on this subject is sufficient, and
we do hint, that abstractedness of manner should never be
exhibited; the greatest geniuses have ever been attentive to
trifles when it so behoved them.


<sc>Accomplishments</sc> are by some considered too trifling for
their attention, but no person desirous of the enjoyments of
social life can spurn them without paying the penalty. Men
of business are frequently denied the leisure necessary to
render themselves moderately proficient in continental languages,
music, dancing, and the arts of pleasing. Yet such
things are essential, and add very much to our enjoyments;
they tend to refine the nature, and form links of connection
between persons of all ages, sexes, and dispositions. It is our
duty to encourage everything of a refining nature, so long as
we lose in the pursuit none of the solid excellencies of character;
and, by a proper attention to such things, we insure
for ourselves reception in quarters where we should be obnoxious
without them. These acquisitions are equally important
to both sexes, though those of the masculine gender are most
guilty of the blunder of setting them at nought.


<sc>Affectation</sc> is more prevalent than people care to own.
Ladies are terribly given to this folly. One affects not to
know the colour of money, unless it be pin-money, and then
her wits are unusually sharp. Another is so fashionable in
her tastes, that she thinks it elegant to take no interest in her
husband’s affairs; so that whether he prosper or fail in life
seems all the same to her. I know a lady who has lately
adopted the affectation of ignorance--a strange kind of affectation
certainly. If she should hear a remark from a scientific
man, in explanation of some curious natural phenomenon, she
will toss her head aside and, with a benign but unmeaning
smile, say, “Indeed! I don’t understand such things.” We
do not seek for blue-stockings, but really we cannot do without
common sense; and the pride of ignorance, whether it be
fashionable or not, must be looked upon as a blunder of tremendous
import. The affectation of superior wisdom is
equally objectionable. If a person tells you something you
already know, you are not to inform him in the middle of his
story that you know it already. It is a mark of a most vulgar
mind to parade your knowledge on any occasion, or seek
repute in society as a person of great attainments. Some
ardent young students are apt to interlard their conversation
with scientific terms and explanations, and with quotations
innumerable from out-of-the-way books. Such things are
well enough in moderation; but if not tempered as to time
and place, stamp the individual as conceited. I knew a man
who, in every respect but one, was a model of deportment and
sound sense; but in the one blunder of which he was guilty he
managed, on every possible occasion, to mar the esteem in
which he was everywhere held. He was a profound chemist,
and on all subjects ready and well informed, but he introduced
chemistry into his conversation so frequently, and soared to
such etherial heights in his theoretic speculations, that his presence
was at last dreaded. The ladies looked at him in awe,
the frivolous young men jeered and tittered, and he was known
at last by the sobriquet of the “Oxygen Nuisance.” But
though few persons carry their conceit so far as this, too many
of us are weak enough to think that what we especially delight
in must prove equally acceptable to all we meet; and affectation,
in this respect, must be guarded against by all who desire
to conduct themselves in society so as to be respected and
esteemed.

Affectation of superiority is worse still, because it galls the
feelings of those to whom it is offered. In company with an
inferior, never let him feel his inferiority. An employer, who
invites his confidential clerk to his house, should treat him in
every way the same as his most distinguished guest. No
reference to business should be made, and anything in the
shape of command avoided. It is very easy by a look, a word,
the mode of reception, or otherwise, to advertise to the other
guests, “This is my clerk,” or, “The person I now treat as
a guest was yesterday labouring in my service;” but such a
thing would lower the host more than it would annoy the
guest. Before Burns had arrived at his high popularity, he was
once invited by some puffed up lairds to dine, in order that
they might have the gratification of hearing the poet sing one
of his own songs. Burns was shown into the servants’ hall,
and left to dine with the menials. After dinner he was invited
to the drawing-room, and, a glass of wine being handed to
him, requested to sing one of his own songs. He immediately
gave his entertainers that thrilling assertion of independence,
“A man’s a man for a’ that,” and left the moment he had
finished, his heart embittered at patronage offered in a manner
so insulting to his poverty.

If you take pains to mortify a man, to make him feel that
he occupies an inferior station, that he stands below you in
abilities, rank, or fortune, you offer him an insult, which,
though he may be too much of a gentleman to resent, nevertheless
he is sure to feel, and for which none of your kindnesses
are a compensation. An inferior is even entitled to
superior attention, that he may not have even the fear of being
slighted; and, above all things, that he have sufficient confidence
in himself, to mingle freely in conversation. True
politeness consists in making everybody happy about you, and
to do otherwise a proof of an uncultivated nature.


<sc>Affronts</sc> are to be borne more patiently than we are wont
to bear them. To resent an affront is usually wrong, and for
these reasons:--We are not always sure that an affront was
intended, in which case resentment must be built upon error.
We are not to carry in our breasts remembrance of every
wrong, for we know not how many we ourselves unconsciously
commit on others. If we cannot bear with trifling annoyances
we must shun human society altogether, for it is a mixture
of such with gratifications. Nature gives us corn with
the chaff on, and in men she presents us with some paltry characters
which we must tolerate. Besides, to take notice of
every trifling annoyance shows too great a study of trifles,
quite apart from the dignified bearing of gentlemanly conduct.
Do not notice every offence, and you will not have many to
trouble you.


<sc>Ball Room.</sc>--Everybody knows it is a blunder to enter
a ball room with the head covered; but everybody does not
know that it is equally so to enter immediately after smoking,
when every lady you speak to must put up with the Stygian
fumes of your tainted breath. As to the elegancies of salutation,
address, and so forth, every person who enters a ball
room must be sufficiently prepared beforehand, by having
mingled in genteel society; such things cannot be taught in
words. Those who can dance know all the forms of ball room
courtesy; but these are apt to commit blunders unless they
study to please. Those unused to the ball room should enter
it with confidence, seek a partner, and after one or two dances
leave. After leading your partner to a seat leave her, but not
abruptly; if you burden her with your society she may fail in
getting another partner. Young men, who have not had much
experience in polite circles, are sometimes so enamoured of a
lady, after one or two dances, as to continue their companionship
throughout the evening. This is a great error; you seek
a partner for the dance only, and not for companionship and
conversation. Do not lounge about the seats as a looker on,
or you will be counted a bore. Should a lady express a wish
not to dance, it is unpolite to press her; and it is equally
unpolite to look after a certain lady as a partner, to haunt her,
as it were, when perhaps she may not have the same desire to
dance with you that you have for her. When a lady has
engaged to dance with you, you are not to afflict her with your
society as a matter of course; indeed, to sit with your partner
for any length of time is a mark of ill-breeding. It is the
thorough mingling of persons one with another that constitutes
the charm of the ball room, and cliques and conversations
are to be avoided. Relatives and lovers should associate
as little as possible in the dance; and a man should but
seldom, except in very homely parties, dance with his wife.
Greetings in the ball room should be quietly performed, so as
not to attract attention.

Ladies are generally <i>au fait</i> in ball room etiquette; but having
once or twice seen a lady rambling in the room by herself,
I will here hint, for the benefit of my fair readers, that a lady
should not leave her seat to cross the room, or speak to a
friend, unless accompanied by a gentleman. A little observation,
and a modest confidence, will enable any person to
acquire ease and elegance in parties where dancing is going on.


<sc>Button-holding.</sc>--Chesterfield inveighs against holding
a man by the button, “for if people are not willing to hear
you, you had much better hold your tongue than them.” Button-holding
is not a common vice, but pointing, nudging,
hitting a man in the side with your fist, or giving him a kick
of recognition under the table, are too common not to be
noticed here as terrible breaches of deportment. Significant
looks and gestures are equally objectionable, and must be
avoided by all who desire to soar above positive vulgarity. I
have often been annoyed by bearing a friend discourse on some
person’s failings or excellencies, the person referred to being
known only to the speaker. It is a bad rule to talk of persons
at all, but more especially if the person spoken of is not known
to all the listeners.


<sc>Calls.</sc>--When you call on a friend and do not find him at
home, leave your card, your name will not be sufficient. After
having made a call, it is the duty of your acquaintance to
return it; and unless it be returned (peculiar circumstances
being allowed for) you must not call again, but infer that he
wishes to drop your acquaintance. This, indeed, is a safe
mode of breaking off an acquaintance, and this is the mode
adopted in polite society. No one complains, but the thing is
silently dropped. In making morning calls, you are not to
stay above ten or fifteen minutes, and during the whole time
you are to keep your hat in your hand, and not part with it
for a moment. This custom seems ridiculous at first sight,
but, like most ceremonies, has a good meaning in it. By
holding your hat you indicate that you are about to leave, and
do not expect an invitation to dinner; while, if your host
wishes you to stay, he will beg you to be relieved of the incumbrance.
It is a ruinous practice to make a call anywhere at
the hour of dinner. You may, perhaps, be invited to sit
down, but if the thing be repeated, your acquaintance will be
unwelcome. This would scarcely seem worth mentioning, but
the practice prevails a good deal, and is a blunder to be guarded
against.


<sc>Children.</sc>--Almost every parent commits the blunder of
making too much of his children in the presence of visitors.
It is very pardonable in fond mothers, but papas are the most
subject to make themselves ridiculous on this score. Remember
the old motto about regarding your geese as swans, and do
not thrust your children on your visitors as prodigies of beauty,
eccentricity, and excellence. The other extreme is just as
bad; and to thrust your children from the room, or to treat
them harshly in the presence of others, makes you look as if
you were ashamed of them. Still, as a rule, children should
not be obtruded on the attention of visitors, or made to exhibit
their parts to those who feel compelled to praise even in spite
of disapprobation. My friend R---- often burdens me with
anecdotes of his boy’s roguery, and this in presence of the
boy himself. Whereupon the child, fired with parental approval,
begins to pinch and pummel me, much to my annoyance;
though I can bear this better than I can to hear my
friend talk of his son’s musical predilections, which always lead
the youngster to a sham pianoforte performance with his
fingers on the table, or to the humming of some tune in a
tone loud enough to stop all conversation.


<sc>Cleanliness</sc> of person is a distinguishing trait of every
well-bred person; and this not on state occasions only, but
at all times, even at home. It is a folly to sit by the fire in a
slovenly state, consoling oneself with the remark, “Nobody
will call to-day.” Should somebody call we are in no plight
to receive them, and otherwise it is an injury to the character
to allow slovenly habits to control us even when we are
unseen.


<sc>Commands</sc> should never be given in a commanding tone.
A gentleman requests, he does not command. We are not to
assume so much importance, whatever our station, as to give
orders in the “imperative mood,” nor are we ever justified in
thrusting the consciousness of servitude on any one. The
blunder of commanding sternly is most frequently committed
by those who have themselves but just escaped servitude, and
we should not exhibit to others a weakness so unbecoming.


<sc>Control of Temper.</sc>--It is very unbecoming to exhibit
petulance, or angry feeling, though it is indulged in so largely
in almost every circle. The true gentleman does not suffer
his countenance to be easily ruffled; and we only look paltry
when we suffer temper to hurry us into ill-judged expressions
of feeling. “He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly.”


<sc>Conversation</sc> ranks the highest among social enjoyments.
To converse well requires extensive knowledge, elegance of
manner, command of temper, and a desire to please. He
who cannot converse to the profit of the company, must listen
for the profit of himself; though no one need preserve a stolid
silence from excessive bashfulness or conscious inability. The
smallest remark may be well-timed and elegantly uttered; the
lightest observation properly pointed and emphasised, and the
most trivial question put with modesty, grace, and elegance
of expression. Yet, in middle-class society, how little really
good conversation do we hear? How frequently personalities
creep in; how one gives way to undue warmth when his religious
and political principles are assailed; how another jests
and puns upon the most serious subjects; or a third plays the
pedant by the use of a string of technicalities, which he himself
scarcely understands, to adorn his shallow learning and his
imperfect judgment. Of that shallow talk in which the fast-going
men of the day indulge--a drawling mixture of the
quasi-fashionable and the idiotic--we do not speak at all, for
it is not conversation but slow prattle, too tinctured with the
germs of vice to be childish, but too silly for the utterance of
men. We speak of what bears the name of conversation
amongst the reading and thinking portion of middle-class
society, which is to be heard at social gatherings, at quiet
dinner parties, and by the family tea-table. The conversation
in these quarters is not equal to the personages; they are apt
to descend below themselves for the sake of displaying incipient
wit, imperfect knowledge, execrable powers of criticism, or
for the achievement of some petty conquest in argument.
Pity that many good societies should be marred by unbridled
and untamed tongues. Pity that conversation is not everywhere
made a matter of study, that men will not exercise as
much care in speaking their thoughts as they do in writing
them.

Among the most glaring social blunders to be noticed under
this head are, talking too much of ourselves. This is a blunder
very commonly committed, and is as much a mark of vanity
as want of sense. Really <i>great men</i> have never said much of
themselves, therefore we may infer, by the converse argument,
that he who indulges in talking of himself must be a really
<i>small man</i>. In the whole of Shakspere’s plays and poems you
do not gather enough of the poet’s history to settle definitely
the question whether he was lame or not, or even to fix, with
any certainty, his opinions on political and religious subjects.
He who talks much of himself is also apt to tell of the injuries
he has sustained. This is a very common blunder, but a most
unpardonable one. It is undignified to carry our woes about
with us, and retail them out to others, saying how such-a-one
has cheated us of money, how another has offered us an
insult, and so on. If you cannot say something cheerful
to your friend, keep at a distance, and let him enjoy at
peace his own cogitations. What are your affairs to other
people? keep your own counsel, and be not too ready to
make confidants.

If you are not to talk of yourself freely, so are you not to
talk freely of others. I regret to have to confess here, that
scandal, in some shape or other, is the bane of our English
society, and needs as severe lashing now-a-days as it did when
Sheridan wrote his wonderful comedy. Though when these
pages meet the reader’s eye he will perhaps be unwilling to
own it, but I will still insist, that both sexes are universally
addicted to this vice in some form or other; and that it is
sheer vanity, or perhaps even shame, which prompts men to
make the charge of scandal against females, while they repudiate
any share in the guilt themselves. The shapes scandal
takes are so numerous, that it is impossible here to attempt
to define them. Let the reader reflect on this, and ask himself
whether he has ever indulged in scandal, even in a mild form.
Let my lady friends, too, ponder awhile, and next time they
find the tongue running away in condemnation of an absent
friend, sister, or brother, or in severe criticism on such and
such a person’s conduct, take the assurance that such conduct
is unkind, unfair, mean, paltry, <i>ungenteel</i>. The quiet, half-expressed
sneer is still more detestable, for it is more injurious,
more insidious in its operation, more secret in its manner, and
hence more discreditable to the utterer. A person who indulges
in depreciatory remarks, insinuations, sneers, and the
like, no matter though he <i>thinks</i> he has good grounds for
them, is like the viper, which steals noiselessly on its unsuspecting
victim, gives its sting in silence, and disappears. To
slander, in plain terms, is better than to hint and insinuate,
but both are evidences of a mean and contemptible mind.

Contradictions are usually given too abruptly, and sometimes
lead to wrangling, or if not noticed by the parties
receiving them, are still apt to rankle and annoy secretly, and
destroy the harmony which ought to prevail in an assembly of
friends. It is equally absurd to make bets or to strengthen a
statement or argument by an offer of a bet in support of it.
Such things are worthy only of the lowest rabble, and no man
making pretensions to the status of a gentleman should descend
to it. Oaths of all kinds are as ungentlemanly as they are
wicked; and the frequent use of the condemnatory oath as
verb, adjective, and noun, both immoral and degrading.

There are some men, of respectable position and pretensions,
who are so barren of general intelligence that they can talk of
nothing except their own business affairs. Such men are very
worthless in social society, and we conjure the reader at all
times to steer clear of conduct which so readily indicates vulgarity
and emptiness. A tradesman will perhaps sit down at
your table, and endeavour to entertain you with an account of
sales and purchases; anon comes a thin-minded solicitor’s
clerk, who brings with him a string of appeals and motions;
then an incipient author, who tells you of the immense mass
of verses he has written for the behoof of cheesemongers and
trunkmakers; and, to wind up, a portly widow repeats for the
hundredth time the story of her troubles, her husband’s failure
and death, and her present endeavours to establish a little
business in the millinery way. Those who sit in such a company,
and withhold, for decency’s sake, the story of their own affairs,
find that the evening has been utterly wasted, for not one spark
of general intelligence, not one item of general information,
not one coruscation of original humour has illuminated the
dull round of these many wasted hours. I would sooner console
myself with a newspaper, and read the list of bankruptcies
and suicides, than listen to a man who indulged in descriptions
of his own skill in trade, his losses and profits, or the
thousand and one trifles which we all have to consider and
remember, but which are of no interest to any but ourselves.

The affectation of wisdom is a very common vice amongst
pseudo-students. For instance, Mr. Smallweed, who is really
a well-informed man, is so conceited in this respect that he
cannot, when the subject of the conversation affords him opportunity,
avoid interlarding his remarks with technicalities and
remote allusions. He would not speak of finches or whales
but under the Cuvierian terms of <i>Fringillidæ</i> or <i>Cetacæ</i>, or refer
to the Canadian columbine, or the field pimpernel, but under
their botanical names of <i>Aquilegia Canadensis</i> or <i>Anagallis
arvensis</i>. Such terms are neither elegant nor appropriate in
mixed society; and so far from causing the ladies to look up
in astonishment at the profound learning of the speaker--an
effect usually intended and wished for--they are more likely
to indulge in a sly titter, and vote his hard words a bother.
This is the “little learning” which Bacon terms “a dangerous
thing” and must be avoided by those who would cultivate good-breeding,
which is always more allied to simplicity of expression,
and transparency of conduct, than to complicated
technicalities, or dark mysterious doings. Another fault
of Mr. Smallweed is, that he never pays proper attention
to another speaker; the music of his own voice is too great a
charm for him, and he thinks it must have a very siren-like
tone to others; so he rambles on till some wag asks him if he
has a dictionary with him, when he drops into sulkiness, looks
black, and is quieted for a time. While upon Mr. Smallweed’s
failings, let me refer to his habitual mode of referring to other
persons, for this fault of his is very common to the civilized
specimen of (to use his phrase) the anthropological animal.
For instance, instead of saying, “My friend, Mr. Simpson,
told me so-and-so,” he invariably says, “Simpson told me so-and-so,”
or, “Longman’s are the publishers of So-and-so’s
book.” A gentleman never drops the “Mr.,” or the “Messieurs,”
the “Dr.,” the “Professor,” or any other title or
mode of address to which persons are entitled. It is ungentlemanly
to speak of “Bulwer’s last novel,” or “the new edition
of Gill’s Commentary.” We should say, “Sir Edward
Lytton Bulwer,” and “Dr. Gill,” and not abbreviate, as if a
respectful mention of a person cost us more breath than he is
worth.

A few short rules for conversation may here be useful; and
I offer them in the fewest words possible, because I think that
for those who wish to cultivate a polite bearing, and conserve
the good feeling which usually accompanies gentlemanly conduct,
a hint is alone sufficient.

1. Do not talk too long together, for fear of tiring your
hearers, and so as to afford others an opportunity of talking
also. 2. Watch your listeners to be sure that they are interested,
and if they appear not to be, allow the conversation to
take its own shape in some other channel. 3. If you observe
a person about to make a remark, give him the opportunity
by pausing and assuming an attentive and <i>expectant</i> countenance.
4. If you tell stories let them be short, pointed, appropriate,
and without digression. 5. Avoid repetitions and
hackneyed phrases. 6. Use as few gestures as possible; on a
Frenchman gestures and grimaces set very well, because they
are natural to the people, but the English gentleman seldom
indulges in pantomime, and never in mimicry. 7. Exercise
your skill as a listener occasionally, and listen attentively and
with appreciation. If you are a listener by nature, and hence
not a talker, do not suffer yourself to become habitually dumb,
or your society will be seldom acceptable. 8. Never anticipate
a slow speaker, and avoid correcting another in his pronunciation.
Friends, on very familiar terms, may correct each
other occasionally, but not in the presence of a third party,
and always in a quiet and respectful manner. 9. Do not give
advice unasked. 10. Give a speaker respectful attention and
look him in the face while speaking. 11. Be not too free in
speaking your mind; remember that your mind may not be
always right, and frankness of speech is not to be commended
when its conclusions are built up by unsound reasoning on
incorrect data; besides, by plain speaking you may frequently
wound a sensitive person, and one, too, having quite as noble
views of things as yourself. People who pride themselves on
speaking their minds are generally very vain of their opinions,
and forgetful of the old motto as to the good intentions with
which a certain place is said to be paved. 12. Never burden
ladies with arguments. They are very wise in dreading them
as they do. 13. Treat females as becomes them, and indulge
none of those vanities, so prevalent at the present day, of
regarding women as inferior beings. 14. Swearing, coarse
jokes, indecent anecdotes, slang phrases, and personal allusions
are very common, but not the less unprofitable, unreasonable,
ungentlemanly, low, and reprehensible. Avoid them; they
are the puddles of the mind, in which the more we dabble the
more we are soiled, degraded, and lessened in the esteem
both of others and ourselves.


<sc>Dining out.</sc>--When entering where you are invited to dine
make your obeisance to the lady of the house, and do not consider
yourself a guest until you have seen her. In leading a
lady down stairs do not rush forward and perform the task
clumsily. In going down the lady should have the widest side,
supposing the stair to have a wide and narrow side, as is the
case with winding staircases. But it is better to take the
wrong side at once than stand perplexed, or to change sides
after once having given a lady your arm. The rule is for the
lady you take down to sit on your right hand; but when you
take down the hostess you should sit on her right hand--namely,
in the seat of honour. Of course every guest cannot
enjoy this privilege, hence, where there are many invited, the
host either assigns her to some favoured guest, or the most
elderly gentleman, or party of highest rank, assumes the office.
It is always better for the host to request some person, whom he
considers his chief guest, to take down the lady of the house.
The other ladies are paired off in the same manner by the
host, whose duty it is to arrange the company so that they may
sit in comfort at the meal. The host himself selects the chief
lady visitor, and leads her off first. The hostess sees all down
before leaving, therefore, if you are to escort her, allow her time
to usher her guests away. A stickler for etiquette, in writing
on this subject, says--

“A custom, lately come in, seems to be deservedly gaining
ground: instead of sitting at the top and bottom of the table,
the host and hostess sit opposite each other at the middle; by
which means they are more at ease, more in the centre of their
guests, and better able to communicate with each other.
George IV. adopted this practice twenty years ago: it is followed
by the present queen. According to this arrangement,
two persons can be accommodated at each end of the table--not
a bad point where there is limited accommodation.

“A dinner party usually lasts four hours. If you go at six,
you may order your carriage at ten; if at seven, it may come
at eleven; and so on. What dinner hours are by-and-bye to
come to I cannot tell. Not many years ago, dinner at five
o’clock was thought mighty genteel; then we had half-past
five; next came six, and six and a-half--both of which are
now general; but seven is also far from uncommon. That
the fashionable dinner hour will be pushed on to eight, to nine,
or to ten, is what we may reasonably expect. When it comes
to this pass, will dinner bound back to its ancient hours, or will
it be extinguished as a formal meal?”

Fashion runs mad occasionally, and it has lately done so in
thrusting the task of carving on ladies. This must be regarded
as a blunder we should hope soon to be corrected. The task
of carving is no light one--it is really a masculine operation,
and utterly inappropriate for the style of ladies’ dresses, manners,
and manual weakness. What fashion insists on, in this
respect, common sense must condemn.

You must make yourself as useful as possible at the dinner-table,
and be attentive in supplying the wants of others, especially
ladies, but avoid obtruding your services. Reaching
across the table is very vulgar, as it is also to indulge any
peculiarities of appetite, such as eating condiments with dishes
with which they are not usually accompanied. I knew an
elderly gentleman who always insisted on having mustard with
his pastry, so that when his favourite condiment had been
removed it had to be brought back for him, causing considerable
disturbance. Good sense will dictate to a person rather
to refrain from eating a particular dish than disarrange the
table in order to gratify an eccentric whim.

To eat quick, or very slow, are marks of ill-breeding; and
to put your nose in your plate, or emit that peculiar bubbling
sound, which some indulge in when imbibing soup, vulgar and
obnoxious. Coughing and sneezing are not always to be
avoided, but much may be done to conserve elegance and propriety
at dinner in checking these and other infirmities.

It is very painful to see a joint carved ungracefully, but
nothing but practice will enable you to carve well. Novices
in life have a great dread of carving poultry, but it is a less
difficult operation than is usually imagined; and I would
advise my readers to practice at home, and acquire ease in such
duties before incurring the responsibility at a friend’s table.
It is better to request some one near you to carve a fowl than
to run the risk of spoiling the bird, and at the same time
bespattering some lady’s dress with the gravy. But guard
against bashfulness in such matters; do with confidence whatever
you feel you can do well, or you will endanger the comfort
of yourself and others.


<sc>Dining at home.</sc>--When you invite several friends to
dine with you have your dinner ready within a short time after
the hour named, but not punctually to a moment, that any who
have not arrived may not feel slighted at your having commenced
dinner. Do not invite, at the same time, persons
who are not on terms with each other, though it is a delicate
matter, always, to take into consideration other people’s differences.
Among kindred it is often advisable to pursue an
opposite course--for many a friendship, among relatives, is
renewed at another table, where petty differences are, of course,
to be forgotten. Study the tastes of your guests; and if there
is any particular dish which your visitors will prefer, set it
before them, and with the remark, “I think I noticed you to
prefer this or that;” or, “I think you are partial to so-and-so,
I therefore obtained it for you.” If you go out of your way
to humour your friend you are not to be too modest to let him
know it, though you are not to exaggerate your attention, and
make him feel that you burden him with attentions.


<sc>Drinking healths</sc> has happily gone out of fashion. Except
in bachelor’s parties, where a few old-school notions
are preserved, it is considered very unpolite to give toasts and
healths.


<sc>Disputes</sc> lead to discord; and a man fond of disputation
soon gets the repute of a quibbler. Objections may be
politely taken without involving the objector in a controversy.
The polite man avoids anything which may lead to a protracted
debate.


<sc>Dress.</sc>--The hostess should be particularly careful not to
outshine her guests. I have seen many instances where ladies,
fond of dress (and what lady is not fond of dress), and conscious
that it is unbecoming to dress to excess when visitors are
invited, yet so unable to restrain the desire of display, have
made the whole of her guests look shabby, by the contrast of
her own gay colours. To dress meanly is a mark of disrespect
to the company, but it is equally so to make a very gay appearance.
If you make a grand display yourself you are apt to
appear as if you wished to parade your appearance, and it is
always safer to be under than over the mark. In going out
consider the sort of company you are likely to meet, and
endeavour to assimilate to them as much as possible--for to
make a great display elsewhere is an evidence of bad taste.
But here, if you miss the happy medium, dress above the
mark rather than below it, for you may dress more out of
doors than you may at home. Where dancing is expected to
take place no one should go without new kid gloves; nothing
is so revolting as to see one person in an assembly ungloved,
especially where the heat of the room, and the exercise
together, are sure to make the hands redder than usual.
Gentlemen seldom indulge in gaudy or light colours; but
quasi-gentlemen do blaze a little in this way, and carry their
character with them accordingly. The abolition of the white
neckcloth is, in my opinion, to be regretted; still, fashion has
declared it shall be used no longer, and at the most <i>recherche</i>
assemblies the gentlemen all wear black stocks or neckerchiefs.


<sc>Eccentricities</sc> should never be indulged away from home.
They are rather the tokens of vanity, than the evidences of
peculiar idiosyncracies. An eccentric man is always dreaded;
and though the world has been indulgent, in this respect, to a
few great geniuses, it is usually very harsh on the matter to
ordinary mortals. Besides, no man was ever great by virtue
of his peculiarities, but in spite of them.


<sc>Excesses.</sc>--It is very common to see persons eat, drink,
and smoke to excess. Such habits are vulgar in the lowest
degree. Some men pride themselves on their abilities in
drinking and smoking--more especially in the latter. These
are blunders that need no reasoning to expose them. The
man who exhibits a tendency to excesses will, sooner or later,
be shunned by all except a few of his own stamp, and not even
by them be respected. Guard against excess in all things, as
neither gentlemanly nor human.


<sc>Engagements.</sc>--Some time ago it was fashionable for
parties to arrive some time after the appointed hour. Fashion
now insists on punctuality--and therein fashion is right. The
unpunctual can never lay claim to gentility.


<sc>Familiarity.</sc>--Too ready an adoption of familiarity is to
be guarded against; and it is a blunder very frequently made
for a person to consider himself on terms of intimacy with
another after one pleasant conversation with him. You may
be delighted with a man the first time you hear him discourse,
but you are not, therefore, to consider yourself his intimate
friend. Eminent literary men, who usually entertain the
company vastly wherever they go, and whose society is much
sought after, are especially apt to be annoyed by the ready
familiarity of persons, of whom they know nothing more than
that, on some previous occasion, they met at dinner. I
remember a case in point:--A person of not very bright parts
or fashionable associations, met for the first time an eminent
writer, Mr. C---- D----. Delighted by his conversation, and
assured by his affability, this person got up a party expressly
to invite Mr. C---- D----, and possibly, also, to display him
to his friends as an intimate acquaintance. The other saw
through the trick the moment the invitation arrived, and at
once accepted it. The evening came, then the guests, and
lastly Mr. C---- D----. All eyes were fixed on him--he
was as attractive as a prize ox. All ears were attentive, and
the happy moment, when he should begin to talk, waited for
with many heart-beatings. But he was too deep for them; he
sat for hours, drank coffee, wine, answered a few questions,
but otherwise spoke not a word. The whole affair was a
miserable failure, and Mr. C---- D---- went away, satisfied,
no doubt, in having inflicted a merited punishment on ill-judged
familiarity, and perhaps resolved to tell the story some
day, better than I have done, in one of his inimitable works.


<sc>Favours</sc> are to be offered without show of patronage, and
accepted without servile gratitude. Not to acknowledge a
favour gracefully is unpardonable, but to load the donor with
sickly gratitude a blunder most abominable.


<sc>Fidgetting.</sc>--Very many people, who have acquired
fidgetty ways, carry them wherever they go to the annoyance
of all who meet them. I once had a visitor who nibbled up a
whole bundle of cigar lights in the course of an evening, and
while so engaged with his fingers and teeth, rubbed a hole with
his foot in a new Brussels carpet. Shifting about in a chair,
putting the legs now on the fender, now under the table,
scratching at pimples, biting the lip, &c., are fidgetty actions,
destructive of a polite bearing.


<sc>Friendship and acquaintance</sc> are to be distinguished
from each other in worldly affairs. Acquaintances sometimes
become the depositories of secrets which should be even
guardedly told to friends. Be wary how you treat a mere
acquaintance, that you do not place your affairs in his hands,
and on the slightest rupture regret having reposed in him too
much confidence. Acquaintances made at convivial meetings
are generally as hollow as the meetings themselves. Under
the temptations of hospitality men confide in each other more
than wisdom would dictate, and the “evening’s diversions”
do not always “bear the morning’s reflections.”


<sc>Homely parties.</sc>--There is a class of recreation that cannot
be too much praised, and which people, in middle class
life, are very apt in making as nearly perfect as possible.
These are Christmas gatherings, birthday and other feasts, and
friendly tea-drinkings, where comfort and hospitality reign
above fashion. Yet, though fashionable arrangements do not
extensively prevail in these, what we hint at, as necessary in
social gatherings of a higher kind, is not to be neglected here.
Politeness of manner, affability of temper, decorum, and proper
taste in dress are things to be considered; for though you are
not required to observe strictly fashionable rules, but to enjoy
yourself in body and mind, much of the comfort depends on
the observance of trifles; and we advise all who love these
unpretending entertainments to study their behaviour as much
in these cases as they would for more fashionable assemblies.
Ease should be preferred to starched formality, but boorishness
should not disgrace the familiarity which is offered by the
host, and expected from the guest.


<sc>Hospitality</sc> goes hand in hand with politeness. When
you invite friends do not treat your own invitation so lightly
that it shall appear you do not value your company. Study to
please and to afford enjoyment, and, in a modest manner, let
your guests see that you do study them, and their pleasure will
be enhanced.


<sc>Hurry.</sc>--A man of sense never exhibits haste. A thing
done in a hurry is not likely to be well done. Some men of
business pride themselves on being always pressed for time,
they think it displays activity of mind; but, on the contrary,
it exhibits weakness and vulgar breeding. Ease of action
does not imply sluggishness of mind, nor does undue haste
betoken importance.


<sc>Imitation.</sc>--There are few who can resist the tendency of
human nature to imitate. Let one young man of a group
take to swearing, and the rest of his juvenile friends will
immediately follow the practice. I have known the style of
conversation, in a complete circle of acquaintance, to be
changed by the peculiarities of one of its members; impressed
with those peculiarities, the rest have set about apeing him to
the best of their poor abilities, and succeeded in making
themselves ridiculous. There is a passage in Shirley Hibberd’s
story of “Cloribel,” which we would offer here as a motto for
every sensible youth, “Be thyself and none other, and we will
love thee, whatsoe’er thou art.” Imitate the perfections, not
the vices, the excellencies rather than the blemishes of a man;
but preserve your individuality as far as you are able.


<sc>Introductions</sc> should be performed with great grace and
judgment. Be careful, too, whom you introduce; I have seen
more than one friend ruined by an ill-judged introduction. It
is a common blunder to introduce persons in the street. If
you meet an acquaintance when you have a friend on your
arm, bow and pass on with a “good day,” or similar greeting,
unless there be special reasons for halting. We only reprobate
street introductions <i>as a rule</i>. There are exceptions to
that as to all rules. We have once or twice been mortified by
a sudden introduction on a door-step. Consider time and
place. It is necessary, too, in most cases, to ask permission
of a friend before you introduce him to another; and a lady
must be introduced to a gentleman, not a gentleman to a lady.


<sc>Invitations.</sc>--The writer from whom we have already
quoted, says on this subject, “When you ask a person to
dinner, let it, if possible, be done a week or ten days in
advance; because, to ask a person only a day or two days
before, looks as if you had been disappointed of somebody
else, and had asked him as a mere stop-gap. A short invitation
is only allowable for off-hand parties, or with strangers
who are passing through a town.

“When you invite a person to dinner, or any other party at
your house, specify only one day. Don’t say you will be glad
to see him on either of two days, as Tuesday or Wednesday
next. And why? Because this person may not wish to dine
with or visit you at all; and so far from a choice of days being
thought an act of kindness, it may be considered one of servility,
if not rudeness. Always state only one day; and let
the invitation, like the answer, be unequivocal.

“Invitations for several weeks in advance are almost as
bad as invitations for alternate days; because long invitations
convey the impression that the inviter is desperately ill off for
guests, and wishes to insure a number at all risks. The person
invited is also apt to feel that it is not <i>his</i> pleasure or convenience
that is consulted; and to raise a feeling of this kind
is anything but consistent with true politeness.

“The receiver of an invitation has a duty to perform as
well as its giver. It is incumbent on him to say <i>yes</i> or <i>no</i> at
once--not to allow a post or a day to elapse before answering.
The reason is obvious: a delay on his part looks as if he were
waiting for a better invitation before he made up his mind.
Not to send a speedy reply, therefore, is one of the worst
pieces of breeding of which a man can be guilty. It is also
not using the inviter well; for a dinner-party usually consists
only of a certain number, and if you cannot accept the invitation,
say so, in order that time may be allowed to invite
another person in your place. Let the answer also be distinct,
no uncertainty is allowable; and if the invitation be accepted,
let it be kept.

“The answer to an invitation should be directed to the lady
of the house.”

An invitation may be refused, or you cannot have a will of
your own; but the refusal should be couched in the kindest,
briefest, and most polite terms.


<sc>Jesting.</sc>--Never make sport of the failings or peculiarities
of another. Such things are common, but none the more
admirable. If a joke is levelled at you, do not suffer your
temper to get the worse of you, but join in the laugh good-temperedly,
and the jester will be beaten by your good humour.
Jests are not always vulgar, and are allowable with familiar
friends, but never with strangers, and always without personality
or ill feeling.


<sc>Ladies.</sc>--Some coxcombs pride themselves on their female
acquaintance, and talk freely to their convivial friends of
them. This is a detestable vice, and at once stamps a man as
base and cowardly. Others affect a contempt for women, and
treat them slightingly. Such conduct is at the least unmanly,
and generally springs from a puffed-up conceit. Deference is
due to woman in every station of society, and is a characteristic
of the true gentleman.


<sc>Leaving Company.</sc>--French leave is the fashion now-a-days
in good society, and we should hope will continue so.
By this method you slip out, shake hands quietly and unobserved
with the host and hostess, and the party goes on undisturbed;
otherwise the movement of one is frequently the
signal for the movement of another, and the party is broken
up prematurely. I have seen, in homely assemblies, a sedate
matron retire to dress, and re-appear with bonnet and shawl on
to shake hands with the whole company. Nothing can be
more vulgar, or detrimental to the life of a party, however
unpretending its character.


<sc>Letters.</sc>--To answer letters promptly, explicitly, and
briefly, is a duty incumbent on every person receiving one.
I have known persons leave letters for weeks unanswered,
with the consoling remark, “Ah! there’s So-and-so’s letter,
I must answer that in a day or two.” What should we think
if we spoke to a man and did not get a reply for a fortnight,
and yet to delay answering a letter is as unbecoming. In
addressing persons, be particular to assign them their proper
rank, and make no difference in your mode of address, even
if a quarrel takes place, unless the intimacy is formally broken
off, when the “Dear Sir” must relapse into the “Sir” again.
I have once or twice been annoyed by a person who had
always addressed me “Dear Sir,” address me as “Sir,” after
I had had a slight difference. I always knew then I had a
paltry mind to deal with, and acted accordingly. Impertinent
and insolent letters are best not answered. Of all things keep
clear of a paper war; it is a conflict in which the gentleman
is sure to be flogged out of you. Long letters are indulged in
very much by the uncultivated, but brevity in writing is the
rule for a gentleman. Invitations by letter should proceed
from the lady of the house, and replies should be addressed
to her in return. I would recommend adherence to this rule,
even in little invitations to tea passing from one friend to
another. They give wives their proper place and importance,
and that is essential to decorum, comfort, and propriety.


<sc>Mourning.</sc>--In calling on a friend who is in distress, put
on a little mourning also, or at least go in no flashy attire. If
your correspondent seals his letters with black, seal yours to
him with black also.


<sc>Mysteriousness.</sc>--Never be dark or mysterious. If propriety
does not allow you to say a thing outright, do not allude
to it at all. A gentleman always attends to those old but
excellent mottoes, “Mind your own business,” and “A still
tongue makes a wise head.”


<sc>Punctuality</sc> is one of the characteristics of politeness.
He who does not keep his appointments promptly is unfit for
the society of gentlemen, and will soon find himself shut out
from it.


<sc>Punning</sc> is of late years very much indulged in. It is not
altogether objectionable, but is liable to become so; for
punsters, like mad dogs, when once started, run on till they
are exhausted. Punning, too, is the lowest species of wit,
and unless puns are most happily pointed, and free from all
personal allusion, they are silly and contemptible. If you
pun, do not laugh at your own joke.


<sc>Purse-pride</sc> is to be seen everywhere, and is always an
evidence of weakness and vulgarity. Make no exhibition of
your means; and if misfortune befal any of your friends, be
still more careful not to display before them your superior
fortune. Many a heart has been rankled by conduct of this
sort, which prevails largely amongst the members of families.


<sc>Quarrels</sc> are lowering to all the parties engaged in them,
and usually terminate in the discomfiture of those who think
they have the strongest side. If you feel you are in the right
you are not justified in making the right ridiculous.


<sc>Ridicule.</sc>--To indulge in ridicule, whether the subject be
present or absent, is to descend below the level of gentlemanly
propriety. Your skill may excite laughter, but will not insure
respect.


<sc>Religion.</sc>--A reverential regard for religious observances,
and religious opinions, is a distinguishing trait of a refined
mind. Whatever your opinions on the subject, you are not to
intrude them on others, perhaps to the shaking of their faith
and happiness. Religious topics should be avoided in conversation,
except where all are prepared to concur in a respectful
treatment of the subject. In mixed societies the subject
should never be introduced.


<sc>Sulkiness</sc> is not often indulged in by grown people, but
we have seen lamentable instances of men, otherwise possessed
of considerable sense, who would sulk for several weeks
together, and during that time refrain from speaking a word to
the most familiar acquaintance, and this, too, for some imaginary
offence, or, if not imaginary, so trifling as to be unworthy
of notice. Such conduct is childish in the extreme; it marks
the first step in the dissolution of the mind, and, if much
indulged, must lead at last to hypochondriasis, or perhaps to
a drivelling and dolorous insanity. The picture of a sulky
man is beyond the region of the pitiful, it is laughable; and
we do laugh, in the same way as we should at the antics of a
melancholy monkey. One who loves silence so much, and
adopts it on such imaginary grounds, deserves to be sent for
ever to Coventry, for in such a one’s society none are safe;
the slightest word may renew the fit, and you are then at his
bidding as a dog would be, to be spoken to and favoured when
he pleases, conscious when you do speak that every word you
utter is fraught with danger to his peace of mind. A morose
man never has many friends, and runs the risk of dying in
old age without even one.


<sc>Salutations</sc> should be suited to the parties saluted. It
is a point much disputed upon whom the obligation of the
first salute lies, when persons of different age or condition
meet. The best rule is for the younger to salute the senior,
as was the custom with the Romans. In meeting a lady there
is no difficulty; the lady salutes first, or no recognition takes
place. I have often been amazed by being stopped in the
street, and held by the hand by a person of whom I had no
recollection whatever, until he told me he had met me at such
a place some months ago. In such a case a bow is all that is
allowed, and this is always to be returned, whether you
remember the person or not; but to halt, and insist on shaking
hands, and entering upon some complimentary small-talk, is
quite an error, unless the parties are on terms of actual
acquaintance. And here I am reminded of the prevalence, at
the present day, of protracted street salutations. You are
suddenly met by an acquaintance who bears down upon you as
the Chesapeake bore down upon the Shannon. You are seized
as in a vice, and your hand held for several minutes. Then
follow sundry questions about your health, when you saw
Smith last, how Robinson’s wife is, what news is there from
the Crimea, and, lastly, treated to some hackneyed remarks
about the Parliament, or the weather. All this takes up valuable
time, obstructs the causeway, and ends in annoyance.
Why not shake hands heartily but briefly, exchange the compliments
of “Good day,” with mutual inquiries after wives
and families, and then part, each to attend to his own affairs,
and each regarding his own business as too important to be
put to the risk of damage by a quarter of an hour spent in
twaddling on a kerb-stone, while the passers by jolt and
thrust against you, and the vehicles cover you with splashes.
The flabby shake of the hand in which some elderly persons
indulge, holding your digits in a slow oscillation till the palms
are moist, is very horrible, and by no means suggestive of
hearty friendship, but it must be borne patiently, sometimes
out of respect to age. When a person of my own age, however,
treats me to one of these damp embraces, I do not hesitate
to withdraw my hand if I can; and if he holds it too tight,
and will not yield, I pinch him more tightly than he likes,
and continue my grip till he breaks down.

Salutations should always be hearty, but softened by politeness;
and in shaking hand with a lady, do not grasp the whole
palm, as you do with your bosom friend, but let the fingers
only meet, and be immediately withdrawn.


<sc>Slights</sc> are easily offered, and not so easily made amends
for. Be careful how you treat sensitive persons, that they
may not think themselves slighted, for no wound goes so deep
as wounded pride.


<sc>Small-Talk.</sc>--Some persons think the small-talk of society
very worthless and degrading, but so far from this being the
case, it is most useful. You cannot expect persons to utter
profound wisdom every time they speak, and small-talk serves
to render persons in some degree acquainted and sociable
before more important topics arise. Besides, good subjects
arise out of small-talk; and conversation that begins in trifles
frequently ends in matters of high profit.


<sc>Secrecy</sc> is essential to the polite man or woman, who do
not repeat all they see and hear or know of people; but
affectation of secrecy is a vulgarity, and never begets confidence.


<sc>Spite and Revenge</sc> are poor instruments, as unchristian
as they are morally degrading. No refined mind indulges in
revengeful feelings. We should be above resenting an injury,
but avoid the society of those who needlessly give offence.
“Avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath:
for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the
Lord. Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he
thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals
of fire on his head. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome
evil with good.”


<sc>Spitting</sc> is a filthy habit, and annoys one in almost every
quarter, in-doors and out. Since vulgarity has had its way so
extensively amongst us, every youth begins to smoke and spit
before he has well cut his teeth. Smoking is unquestionably a
great pleasure to those accustomed to it, that it must not be
condemned; yet the spitting associated with it detracts very
much from the enjoyment. No refined person will spit where
ladies are present, or in any public promenade; the habit is
disgusting in the extreme, and one would almost wish that it
could be checked in public by means of law.


<sc>Surliness</sc> is far from the amiability and gentleness which
true refinement teaches us. There is a vast deal of surliness
to be encountered from puffed-up tradespeople and small professionals,
but it is never the mark of mental polish.


<sc>Vanity.</sc>--Most of us are too vain; and I fear the gentle
sex must be charged with somewhat of an excess in this particular.
We are not to sneer at the vanity of others, and
endeavour to mortify them therein, but first look to ourselves,
that we are not equally vain in our own particular manner. A
vain display is always an abject thing, and may be dispensed
with profitably.


<sc>Vulgarities.</sc>--We often have inward promptings of the
vulgarity of our actions; there is a sort of instinctive propriety
in all of us, and whenever we heed these monitions
from within, we are pretty sure to be in the right. If you
have a doubt at any time of the propriety of an action, let
instinct guide you, and you are safe. I have observed that it
is very common for persons to talk very loud when in conversation
with foreigners, as if increase of noise would compensate
for difficulties of mutual understanding. In omnibus
and railway travelling there is a good deal of bawling, treading
on toes, thrusting of elbows into sides, crushing, crowding,
and running to and fro. In the midst of all this confusion
the gentleman, punctual to time, walks with ease to his place,
takes his seat without hurry or noise, and, in securing his own
comfort, regards the comfort of others by a spirit of conciliating
accommodation. The other day, while riding in an
omnibus, I was much annoyed, as were others of the passengers,
by two females (I regret I cannot say <i>ladies</i>), who sat
with heads protruding from the windows, shouting and passing
pleasantries to some acquaintance on the pathway. Rudeness
of any kind on such occasions causes annoyance to all who
witness it.

Avoid all boastings and exaggerations, backbiting, abuse,
and evil speaking; slang phrases and oaths in conversation;
depreciate no man’s qualities, and accept hospitalities of the
humblest kind in a hearty and appreciative manner; avoid
giving offence, and if you do offend, have the manliness to
apologise; infuse as much elegance as possible into your
thoughts as well as your actions; and as you avoid vulgarities
you will increase the enjoyment of life, and grow in the
respect of others.


<sc>Whispering</sc> is often indulged in by the young; and my
parting advice to all is, never to whisper, either in the presence
or absence of others. What you cannot say plainly do
not say at all; and by never indulging in the practice you
will never give way to it unconsciously in the presence of those
who may think you are whispering of them.


<sc>Concluding Hints.</sc>--Adapt your greetings to the ages
and conditions of persons, but do not lapse into stiffness
on one hand, and excess of freedom on the other. Age
demands respect in all conditions of life, and superiors in
station should have the deference to which they are entitled.

When offered a seat, or invited to sit to a meal, you are, in
all ordinary cases, bound to accept the invitation without
hesitation. If you find your friend dining, you cannot expect
him to talk to you, unless you join him at his request. If
you refuse, he must finish hastily in order to entertain you.

In passing narrow ways, such as doorways and the like,
step aside in time for your superior to pass before you; and
if he request you to precede him, you must do so at once. If
you are the superior, it is a graceful action to motion your
companion to take the precedence. No one likes to be the
lag-behind by compulsion.

In the street, if a person bows to you, you are bound to
return the salutation, even if you do not remember him. You
may remember when he has passed, and bitterly regret the
neglect of courtesy. Ladies should be on the alert while
walking, to give polite obeisance to any friend who may pass,
for in this case the gentleman cannot offer the salute; the onus
rests with the lady whether recognition shall take place
or not.

At a party, if you wish to tell any visitor that his cab or
other vehicle is waiting for him, you must use the word <i>carriage</i>.
All vehicles are carriages that bring visitors, and no
lady or gentleman wishes it to be advertised to the room that
their <i>cab</i>, or wheelbarrow, is waiting for them.
